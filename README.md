[![Build Status](http://quickcheck-ci.com/p/hanssv/example_proj.png)](http://quickcheck-ci.com/p/hanssv/example_proj)

A small example project. The only purpose of this project is to serve as a demonstrator 
for QuickCheck CI (http://quickcheck-ci.com/). That means that the interesting parts of
this project is *not* the code, nor the properties. Instead, the interesting bits are
the configuration file (./.eqc_ci), the licence file (./EQC_CI_LICENCE.txt), and this
readme file (./README.md).
